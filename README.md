# <span id = "2">2. Dynamic Programming</span>
“Programming” in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.

## 2.1 Divide-and-conquer VS Dynamic progrmming alg

<img src="./files/DynamicProg/venn_DPalg.png"/>



## 2.2 Four steps for Dynamic Programming alg:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.

2. Recursively deﬁne the value of an optimal solution.

3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.

4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

## 2.3 Characteristics
***optimal substructure***: optimal solutions to a problem incorporate/consists of optimal solutions to related subproblems, which we may solve independently.

[<p align="right"> GO TO TOP.</p>](#CMSC441--641-Algorithm)

## 2.4 Two ways to implement a dynamic-programming approach
### 2.4.1 top-down with memoization
- Recursively sovle problems as usual and memoized.
- But in each recursion frst check whether this subproblem has previously solved.
### 2.4.2 down-top
- Sort subproblems in size and solve them in size order.
- When solving a particular subproblem, we have already solved all of the smaller subproblems its solution depends upon, and we have saved their solutions

Dynamic programming thus **uses additional memory to save computation time**; it serves an example of a **time-memory trade-off**. The savings may be dramatic: an exponential-time solution may be transformed into a polynomial-time solution. A dynamic-programming approach runs in polynomial time when the number of distinct subproblems involved is polynomial in the input size and we can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time.

# <span id="4">4. Graph Theory</span>

## <span id="411">4.1.1 Graph</span>

**Graph**: G = (V, E). Self loop: (v, v).

**Undirected Graph**: Wire, Traffic netowkrs.

**Directed Graph**: Status transition, Markov model.

**Sparse Graph**: |E| << $|V|^2$.

**Dense Graph**: |E| $\approx$< $|V|^2$.

**Weighted Graph**: Distance, Density. 

**Adjacency-list** representation V.S. **Adjacency-matrix** representation:

<img src="./files/Graph/graph_representation.png"></img>


When programming, how represent adjacency-list?
-  List, forward list.
-  Vector.              ```// Don't change often. Quicker. Easy for reading and writing.```
-  Set, unordered set.  ```// Easy for looking up.```

## <span id="412">4.1.2 Searching Algorithms:</span>

- **BFS**: Like water wave. Similiar to Tree‘s hierarchy traversal but the difference is we need to label whether we have visited this node or not, which is not necessary in THT.

  - Code: <a href="https://github.com/xiexiexx/Planet/blob/master/breadth_first_search/BFS.cpp">cpp</a>(<a href="./files/Graph/BFS.cpp">Backup</a>). 


- **DFS**: Widely used. Try best to visit as deeply as possible.

  - Code:.

For more, see <a href="./files/Graph/12.1 Graph Algorithms.pdf">Graph theory slides of Dr. Chang</a>.
Or see CSE12 PA3, Lecture08, MAZE Stack Queue BFS DFS of UCSD.

Usually, use ***queue*** to implement the BFS, use ***stack*** to implement DFS. 

BFS/queue explore all possible nodes at same level/distance before moving further to next level/distance+1. 
- This property makes it pretty good at finding ***shortest path***, because it will explore all possible paths with length l before to explore all possible paths with length l+1. 
- This property also makes it visit some nodes which are unnecessary for shortest path, which means more memory usage.

DFS/stack will stick with one direction once it's possible to continue. It doesn't stop that direction until it goes to a dead end. Then it switches to another direction. So DFS might find the shortest path but cannot guarantee it. 

Queue in java can be implemented using LinkedList or ArrayList. Stack in java can be implemented using Stack calss. 

[Difference between BFS and DFS Binary Tree:](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs.html)
|BFS|	DFS|
|:-|:-|
|BFS finds the shortest path to the destination.|	DFS goes to the bottom of a subtree, then backtracks.|
|The full form of BFS is Breadth-First Search.|	The full form of DFS is Depth First Search.|
|It uses a queue to keep track of the next location to visit.|	It uses a stack to keep track of the next location to visit.|
|BFS traverses according to tree level.|	DFS traverses according to tree depth.|
|It is implemented using FIFO list.|	It is implemented using LIFO list.|
|It requires more memory as compare to DFS.|	It requires less memory as compare to BFS.|
|This algorithm gives the shallowest path solution.|	This algorithm doesn't guarantee the shallowest path solution.|
|There is no need of backtracking in BFS.|	There is a need of backtracking in DFS.|
|You can never be trapped into finite loops.|	You can be trapped into infinite loops.|
|If you do not find any goal, you may need to expand many nodes before the solution is found.|	If you do not find any goal, the leaf node backtracking may occur.|

# <span id="6">6. Tree, Binary Search Tree </span>

Definition: A ***BST (Binary Search Tree)*** is a tree, where at **every** node, all keys to the **left** of that node is **smaller** than that key, and all keys to the **right** are **larger**.


PAE: print all elements. 

[PAE/searching algorithms: (more)](files/tree/pae.md)

|  Pre-order, O(n) | Level-order, O(n)   |  
|  In-order, O(n)  |   |

# <span id="7">7. Heap, PriorityQueue, Heap sort </span>


Definition: A tree is a ***complete tree*** if every level but the last level is completely full, and the last level has its nodes all the way to **left**. 

Property: A complete tree's size and height are related by: *height ~ log(size).*

Definition: A tree is ***max/min heap order*** if every node's key is **greater/less** than or equal to all its childrens' keys.

Definition: A ***max/min heap*** is a **complete tree** that is **max/min heap order**.

### **Priority Queue:**
|List|Queue|Stack|Map|PriorityQueue|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|List<E> {</br>void add(E e); </br>E get(int index); </br>} |Queue<E>{</br> void enqueue(E e); </br> E dequeue();</br>}|Stack<E> {</br> void push(E e); </br> E pop();</br>}|Map<K, V><E> {</br> void set(K k, V v); </br> V get(K k);</br>}|PriorityQueue<K, V><E> {</br> void set(K k, V v); </br> V pull();</br>Entry<K, V> poll()*;</br>}|
|||||Use heap to implement.|


(\* return and remove max/largest key.)

</br>


Heap keys don't need to be unique. 

Poll(): remove the largest node (root) by swap it with right-est node (last node in array). Then use bubble dowm, i.e. swap with largest child. **\theta(logn).**

Add(): if the added node is largest, add it to the end and then use bubble up, i.e. swap with it parent if it's larger than it's parent. **\theta(logn).**



### **Heap sort:**
<img src="files/heap/heapsort.png" ></img>
**\theta(nlogn)**
