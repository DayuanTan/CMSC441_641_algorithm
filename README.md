## 2. Dynamic Programming

“Programming” in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.

### 2.1 Divide-and-conquer VS Dynamic progrmming alg

### 2.2 Four steps for Dynamic Programming alg:

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively deﬁne the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

### 2.3 Characteristics

_**optimal substructure**_: optimal solutions to a problem incorporate/consists of optimal solutions to related subproblems, which we may solve independently.

### 2.4 Two ways to implement a dynamic-programming approach

#### 2.4.1 top-down with memoization

* Recursively sovle problems as usual and memoized.
* But in each recursion frst check whether this subproblem has previously solved.

#### 2.4.2 down-top

* Sort subproblems in size and solve them in size order.
* When solving a particular subproblem, we have already solved all of the smaller subproblems its solution depends upon, and we have saved their solutions

Dynamic programming thus **uses additional memory to save computation time**; it serves an example of a **time-memory trade-off**. The savings may be dramatic: an exponential-time solution may be transformed into a polynomial-time solution. A dynamic-programming approach runs in polynomial time when the number of distinct subproblems involved is polynomial in the input size and we can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time.

## 4. Graph Theory

### 4.1 Graph

**Graph**: G = \(V, E\). Self loop: \(v, v\).

**Undirected Graph**: Wire, Traffic netowkrs.

**Directed Graph**: Status transition, Markov model.

**Sparse Graph**: \|E\| &lt;&lt; $\|V\|^2$.

**Dense Graph**: \|E\| $\approx$&lt; $\|V\|^2$.

**Weighted Graph**: Distance, Density.

**Adjacency-list** representation V.S. **Adjacency-matrix** representation:

[![](.gitbook/assets/graph_representation.png)](https://github.com/DayuanTan/CMSC441_641_algorithm/blob/master/Graph/graph_representation.png)

When programming, how represent adjacency-list?

* List, forward list.
* Vector. // Don't change often. Quicker. Easy for reading and writing.
* Set, unordered set. // Easy for looking up.

**Searching Algorithms:**

* **BFS**: Like water wave. Similiar to Tree‘s hierarchy traversal but the difference is we need to label whether we have visited this node or not, which is not necessary in THT.
  * Code: [cpp](https://github.com/xiexiexx/Planet/blob/master/breadth_first_search/BFS.cpp)\([Backup](https://github.com/DayuanTan/CMSC441_641_algorithm/blob/master/Graph/BFS.cpp)\).
* **DFS**: Widely used. Try best to visit as deeply as possible.
  * Code:.
